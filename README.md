# Distributed-Resource-Management

Implements a distributed resource-management scheme using <b>Akka actors<b>. This allows us to simulate a distributed system, where a node wants to share their resources with all nodes in the network. This project allows for user and management roles, each with their own respective functionality. Supports message forwarding if a user wants to access a resource which is not locally available.
